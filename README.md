corroborator
============

Case management with data validation, corroboration, omission and duplication checking

Installation
==========

virtualenv should be used for package management
To install virtualenv
```
[sudo] apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Other packages are required for modules and other build dependencies:
```
[sudo] apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev python-dev mysql-client libxslt-dev libgeos-c1 ffmpeg git
```

#### Install local python environment
From the root folder run:

```
virtualenv --python=python2.7 env --no-site-packages
```

#### Install required packages
```
env/bin/easy_install -U distribute
env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Set up system celeryd install
Install celeryd
```
apt-get install python-celery
```

On Debian, the configuration file for celeryd exists in /etc/default/celeryd - an example configuration file is provided in conf/celeryd.conf. Paths in this configuration file must be modified first. The celery daemon must be restarted once this file is installed via ```/etc/init.d/celeryd restart```.

#### pull in git submodules
```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

#### Create and configure database
In mysql, create a database and user for the app:
```
CREATE DATABASE corroborator_staging;
CREATE USER 'django'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
GRANT ALL ON corroborator_staging.* to 'django'@'localhost';
```
Add this username and password combination to DATABASE in ```corroborator/settings/staging.py```.

#### Initial db sync
If you have no database set up, run
```
env/bin/python2.7 managestaging.py syncdb
env/bin/python2.7 managestaging.py migrate
```

### Solr installation

Solr needs a few packages installed before use:
```
[sudo] apt-get install supervisor openjdk-6-jdk
```

Solr installation is a simple matter of untarring and chowning the
file as is appropriate for your webserver configuration. Some extra
configuration is required, as detailed in the section below.

Solr can be tempermental so we run it via Supervisord. An example
configuration file for solr exists in ```conf/solr.supervisor.conf```
- it can be dropped into ```/etc/supervisor/conf.d/``` on Debian. Make
sure to change the paths as required.

#### Other configuration
Assuming that you have Solr and Apache all good to go, you should be ready now.

If you encounter the error ```ApiKey matching query does not
exist. Lookup parameters were {'user': <User: root>}``` (or for
another user), create an API key in the https://yoursite/admin panel.

Solr Usage
==========

Changes to model schema where new fields are added or removed from Bulletin, Incident or Actor
models will require an update to the solr schema. To do this the schema.xml file must be updated.
Haystack will generate a new schema.xml file with the command

```
env/bin/python manage.py build_solr_schema > schema.xml --settings=[local settings]
```
from the root dir of the project

you must then copy this file to the conf folder of your solr instance and add this line under the fields section
```
<field name="_version_" type="long" indexed="true" stored="true"/>
```

The schema can then be re-generated by running
```
env/bin/python manage.py rebuild_index --settings=[local settings]
```
